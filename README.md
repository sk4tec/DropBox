# DropBox

The app is a WPF App. I did note that the instructions were to prefer WinUI3. I chose WPF as this is what my experience is based
on and I didn't want to add any friction of a (slighty) different framework. I do intend on recreating this in WinUI 3 in my spare time.

The App build in Visual Studio 2022. It should just open, build and run. 

It uses default folders that I worked on which are as follows:

The default Input folder:
C:\Test\Input

The default Target (Output) folder:
C:\Test\Output

These values can be changed with the Select Folder button(s)

When the app starts there's a trace message "Ready...". I've also got a Beep when a file has synced.
